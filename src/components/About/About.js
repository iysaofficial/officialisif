          By looking at the development and knowledge of children today about
          science, invention and innovation, especially in the field of science,
          it requires us to know the extent of the student’s insights, knowledge
          and abilities in applying their knowledge of science. Therefore, our
          Indonesian Young Scientist Association (IYSA) Indonesia will hold an
          international level Invention competition called “International
          Science and Invention Fair (ISIF)" as the right learning platform to
          nurture our young talented inventors who are active, creative and
          innovative.
